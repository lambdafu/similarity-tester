These programs test for similar (or equal) stretches in one or more program
files and can be used to detect common code or plagiarism. See sim.1.
Checkers are available for C, Java, Pascal, Modula-2, Lisp, Miranda and
natural text.

>>>> NEW, June 6, 2012:
     - greatly improved percentage computation
     - // comments in C recognized
     - chars 0200-0377 accepted in sim_text
     - s p a c e d   w o r d s recognized in sim_text
     - UNICODE file names accepted
     - manual page in PDF

==== To install on UNIX/Linux, or on MSDOS if you have a C compiler:

Unpack the archive sim_2_*.zip

Compile and test, by calling
	make test
This will generate one executable called sim_c, the checker for C, and will
run two small tests to show sample output.

To install, examine sysidf.mk, reset BINDIR and MAN1DIR to sensible paths,
and call
	make install

To change the default run size or the page width, adjust the file settings.par
and recompile.

==== To install on MSDOS, if you don't have a C compiler:

	SIM.TXT			a short manual, UNIX-style
	SIM_C.EXE		similarity tester for C
	SIM_JAVA.EXE		similarity tester for Java
	SIM_PASC.EXE		similarity tester for Pascal
	SIM_M2.EXE		similarity tester for Modula-2
	SIM_LISP.EXE		similarity tester for Lisp
	SIM_MIRA.EXE		similarity tester for Miranda
	SIM_TEXT.EXE		similarity tester for text

==== To extend:

To add another language L, write a file Llang.l along the lines of clang.l
and the other *lang.l files, extend the Makefile and recompile.
All knowledge about a given language L is located in Llang.l; the rest of
the programs expect each token to be a 16-bit character.

Available at present:
	clang.l javalang.l pascallang.l m2lang.l lisplang.l miralang.l text.l
