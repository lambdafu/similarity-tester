/*	Text is compared by comparing every substring to all substrings
	to the right of it; this process is in essence quadratic.  However,
	only substrings of length at least 'MinRunSize' are of interest,
	which gives us the possibility to speed up this process by using
	a hash table.

	For every position in the text, we construct an index which gives
	the next position in the text at which a run of MinRunSize tokens
	starts that has the same hash code, as calculated by hash1().  If
	there is no such run, the index is 0.  These forward references are
	kept in the array forward_references[].

	To construct this array, we use a hash table last_index[] whose size
	is a prime and which is about 8 times smaller than the text array.
	The hash table last_index[] is set up such that last_index[i] is the
	index of the latest token with hash_code i, or 0 if there is none.
	This results in hash chains of an average length of 8.  See
	MakeForwardReferences().

	If there is not enough room for a hash table of the proper size
	(which can be considerable) the hashing is not efficient any more.
	In that case, the forward reference table is scanned a second time,
	eliminating from any chain all references to runs that do not hash to
	the same value under a second hash function, hash2().  For the UNIX
	manuals this reduced the number of matches from 91.9% to 1.9% (of
	which 0.06% was genuine).

	We want a hash function whose time cost does not depend on
	MinRunSize, which is a problem since the size of the value
	we derive the hash function from IS equal to MinRunSize!
	Therefore we base the hash function on a sample of at most 24
	tokens from the input string; this works at least as well in
	practice.  These 24 token values will result in exactly 31
	bits under the hashing algorithm used, which avoids an

	run size (although the fit is surprising!)
