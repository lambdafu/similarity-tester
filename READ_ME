These programs test for similar (or equal) stretches in one or more program
files and can be used to detect common code or plagiarism. See sim.1.
Checkers are available for C, Java, Pascal, Modula-2, Lisp, Miranda and
natural text.

This READ_ME file describes the UNIX/Linux version. The MSDOS version is
described in the file READ.ME.

To obtain the sources, unpack the archive sim_2_*.zip

To compile and test, just call
	make
This will generate one executable called sim_c, the checker for C, and will
run two small tests to show sample output.

To install, examine sysidf.mk, reset BINDIR and MANDIR to sensible paths,
and call
	make install.sim_c			for C
	make install.sim_java			for Java
	make install.sim_pasc			for Pascal
	make install.sim_m2			for Modula-2
	make install.sim_lisp			for Lisp
	make install.sim_mira			for Miranda
	make install.sim_text			for text
or
	make install.all			for everything.
These will also install the manual page.

To change the default run size or the page width, adjust the file params.h
and recompile.

To add another language L, write a file Llang.l along the lines of clang.l
and the other *lang.l files, extend the Makefile and recompile.
All knowledge about a given language L is located in Llang.l; the rest of
the programs expect each token to be a single character.

Available at present:
	clang.l javalang.l pascallang.l m2lang.l lisplang.l miralang.l text.l
